        <p>Hi. I'm Marjorie!</p>

<pre><code> When I first entered the Academy as a sophomore, I didn't really know what to expect. We first started off by using the program Photoshop, which I have used before, so I knew what to do and was able to finish my work early. Same with HTML and CSS. By the end of the year we used Flash. I enjoyed my first year in the Academy because I worked mostly with graphic arts and design; I didn't know I liked it until we edited photos on Photoshop.
 I was excited to hear that we were going to film and edit videos for our second year of AME. Film making has always been hobby of mine, so it was a positive opportunity for me to learn more about the types of camera angles and editing programs. I was often the director, writer, and editor of the films. Being the director often allowed me to also be the leader, so I used that chance to get to know my team mates and make sure everyone was content with the product. AME II was a good time for me, as I was able to explore more into my hobbies and interests. 
 In this final year of AME, we focused mainly on social justice. This allowed us to be more vocal about the injustices going on in our community and the US. My favorite project from this year was "One Minute." It showed the many occurrences that can happen in just one minute! Statistics show that hundreds of people in the world die in one minute, while you can be laying around on your phone, living a good life. Three years of AME unlocked the creativity within me, where I expressed it through the films we created.
